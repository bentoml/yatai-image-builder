# yatai-image-builder

yatai-image-builder is a yatai component dedicated to building container images for Bento

## Description

yatai-image-builder runs in k8s, it is the operator of `BentoRequest` CRD, it is responsible for reconcile `BentoRequest` CR and then build the image for Bento, after the image is built `Bento` CR is generated, [yatai-deployment](https://github.com/bentoml/yatai-deployment) component will depend on Bento CR to deploy Bento in k8s

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/yatai-image-builder:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/yatai-image-builder:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

Contributing code or documentation to the project by submitting a Github pull request. Check out the [Development Guide](https://github.com/bentoml/yatai-image-builder/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md).

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make start-dev
```

**NOTE:** The more information you should check the [Development Guide](https://github.com/bentoml/yatai-image-builder/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md).

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
