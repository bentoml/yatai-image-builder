                            MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which
                            spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                            incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector
                            to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
                            for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                            MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                            Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will
                            be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.

                            This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).

                            MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                            between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                            The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                            or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                            In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                            - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                            scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                            violate MaxSkew(1).
                            - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                            to topologies that satisfy it.
                            It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                            MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                            When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                            Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                            And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                            this value has no effect on scheduling.
                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                            scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                            If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                            Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                            When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                            The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                            In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                            because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew.

                            Ready specifies whether the container is currently passing its readiness check.

                            The value is typically used to determine whether a container is ready to
                            accept traffic.

                      nominatedNodeName is set only when this pod preempts other pods on the node, but it cannot be
                      scheduled right away as preemption victims receive their graceful termination periods.
                      This field does not guarantee that the pod will be scheduled on this node. Scheduler may decide
                      to place the pod elsewhere if other nodes become available sooner. Scheduler may also decide to
                      give the resources on this node to a higher priority pod that is created after preemption.
                      As a result, this field may be different than PodSpec.nodeName when the pod is
                      scheduled.

                      The phase of a Pod is a simple, high-level summary of where the Pod is in its lifecycle.
                      The conditions array, the reason and message fields, and the individual container status
                      arrays contain more detail about the pod's status.
                      There are five possible phase values:

                      Pending: The pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes system, but one or more of the
                      container images has not been created. This includes time before being scheduled as
                      well as time spent downloading images over the network, which could take a while.
                      Running: The pod has been bound to a node, and all of the containers have been created.
                      At least one container is still running, or is in the process of starting or restarting.
                      Succeeded: All containers in the pod have terminated in success, and will not be restarted.
                      Failed: All containers in the pod have terminated, and at least one container has
                      terminated in failure. The container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated
                      by the system.
                      Unknown: For some reason the state of the pod could not be obtained, typically due to an
                      error in communicating with the host of the pod.
